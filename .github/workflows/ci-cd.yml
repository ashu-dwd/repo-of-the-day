      # ----- Deployment Example Section -----
      # Add your deployment steps here (manual, rsync, ssh, push to registry, etc.)
      # - name: Deploy to production server
      #   run: |
      #     echo "Deploy step goes here"
      #   env:
      #     # Set up environment variables for your secrets/host info etc.
# Instructions:
# 1. This workflow runs on every push or PR to main/master.
# 2. Customize the "Deployment Example Section" for your infrastructure (VPS via SSH, cloud platforms, registries, etc.)
# 3. Add tests/lint steps in package.json to make the workflow more robust.
